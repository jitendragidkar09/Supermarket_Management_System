<pre>Welcome to the Supermarket Management System, a comprehensive Java-based application designed to streamline the management of supermarket operations. This application features user authentication, product management, seller management, and a billing module to facilitate smooth and efficient transactions.</pre>
<br>
<pre>
In this Project I created a Java swing application of supermarket management. The Application starts with a nice looking splash form which leads to a login form. The login form will be connected to a database, if the user id and password match the database entries, the user will login to the main form.
The Admin can go to the product form. He can add, edit, delete and view product stock.
The Admin can manage the different sellers which can sell products to  clients 
Finally, the Client can sell medicine by using the Billing module and by printing the Bill to the client.
